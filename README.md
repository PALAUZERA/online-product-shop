## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, efficient search capabilities are crucial for any online product shop. This repository investigates **Elasticsearch**, a powerful search engine that enables fast and scalable searches. Our goal is to showcase how Elasticsearch can enhance product discovery and improve user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several technologies to create a robust environment:

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies multi-container applications.
- **Elasticsearch**: The core search engine for product data.
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Kotlin**: A modern language for JVM development.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing product data.
- **Sharding**: Techniques for distributing data across multiple nodes.
- **Sharding JDBC**: For managing sharding in a database.
- **VM**: Virtual machines for running applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Online Product Shop, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PALAUZERA/online-product-shop.git
   cd online-product-shop
   ```

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can find installation instructions on the official [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

3. **Set Up Environment**: Create a `.env` file to configure your environment variables. Use the provided `.env.example` as a reference.

4. **Build and Run the Application**: Use Docker Compose to build and run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Once the containers are up and running, access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### Elasticsearch Integration

Elasticsearch provides a powerful search capability. Hereâ€™s how to interact with it:

1. **Indexing Products**: Use the provided API to index new products.
2. **Searching Products**: Implement search functionality to retrieve products based on user queries.
3. **Sharding Configuration**: Configure sharding to distribute product data across multiple nodes.

### Sample API Endpoints

- **Index Product**: `POST /api/products`
- **Search Products**: `GET /api/products/search?query={query}`

### Example Usage

To index a new product, send a POST request to `/api/products` with the product details in JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "Sample Product",
  "price": 29.99,
  "description": "This is a sample product."
}
```

To search for products, send a GET request to `/api/products/search?query=sample`.
